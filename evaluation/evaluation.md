# Evaluation

## Achievements

All the targets set out in the analysis were met when testing the program.

## Expanding the Project

- Recognising more characters would make the calculator even more versatile. For example: ^ for exponents, . for rational numbers, ~ for unary minus, âˆš for roots.
- A menu could be implemented to make the program more user friendly. For example, an option for doing calculations, an option for displaying valid characters and an option to exit the program.
- The menu would loop so that multiple calculations can be done before the program terminates.
